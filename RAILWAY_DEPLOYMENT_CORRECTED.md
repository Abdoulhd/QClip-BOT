# 🚀 QClip Telegram Bot - Railway Deployment (Corrected)

Based on Railway's best practices for Telegram bots, I've updated the configuration to properly deploy your bot as a **Worker** service using long-polling.

## ✅ Configuration Updates

### 1. Service Type Changed to Worker
- **Before**: Web service with port binding
- **After**: Worker service for long-polling bots
- **Reason**: Telegram bots using long-polling don't need to listen on a port

### 2. Entry Point Updated
- **Before**: `web: python main.py`
- **After**: `worker: python bot.py`
- **Reason**: Direct entry point without intermediate file

### 3. Configuration Files
- **Removed**: railway.json (non-standard)
- **Added**: railway.toml (Railway standard)
- **Updated**: Procfile for Worker service

## 📁 Final File Structure

```
├── railway.toml            # Railway configuration
├── Procfile                # Process configuration (worker: python bot.py)
├── requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
├── QClip.csv               # Quran data (6,236 verses)
├── bot.py                  # Main bot implementation
├── README.md               # Documentation
└── .gitignore              # Git exclusions
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done)
2. **Create Railway Project**:
   - Visit [Railway](https://railway.app)
   - Create new project
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose **Worker** service type
   - Connect your GitHub repository
3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Name: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your actual Telegram bot token from @BotFather
4. **Deploy**:
   - Railway will automatically detect the Python project
   - Will use railway.toml for configuration
   - Will run `worker: python bot.py` from Procfile

## ✅ Best Practices Applied

1. **Correct Service Type**: Worker for long-polling bots
2. **Standard Configuration**: railway.toml instead of railway.json
3. **Direct Entry Point**: No intermediate main.py file
4. **Proper Environment Variables**: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
5. **Clean File Structure**: Only essential files included

## 📋 Verification Checklist

- [x] Worker service type selected
- [x] Procfile with `worker: python bot.py`
- [x] railway.toml configuration
- [x] requirements.txt with python-telegram-bot
- [x] All essential files present
- [x] No unnecessary files included
- [x] Environment variable configured

## 🛠️ Expected Deployment Logs

After successful deployment, you should see:
```
Bot started polling
```

This indicates your Telegram bot is running correctly and waiting for messages.
